# DCS-Config-Manager



Things to note:
- Windows 10s SmartScreen will not trust it in the early weeks of release, as I do not have a code signing certificate
- This also applies to cloud connected anti-malware. If they ask if you want to submit it - please do. So I get get "vetted" :-)
- If you're really paranoid (and I won't blame you for that), grab the source, check the code and compile it yourself. 


Changelog:

28.10.2017 - RC3
- Added line tab seperator
- Disabled text wrap for directory textbox and lowered font size for more visibility
- Anti-Aliasing enabled for images


Todo: 

Easy: 

Medium:
- Icons for shortcuts
- Textbox for VR is shit

Hard:
- maybe look at vR option to automatically create configs (would solve textbox thing as well)
