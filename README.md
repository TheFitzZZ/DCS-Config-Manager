# DCS-Config-Manager



Things to note:
- Windows 10s SmartScreen will not trust it in the early weeks of release, as I do not have a code signing certificate
- This also applies to cloud connected anti-malware. If they ask if you want to submit it - please do. So I get get "vetted" :-)
- If you're really paranoid (and I won't blame you for that), grab the source, check the code and compile it yourself.
